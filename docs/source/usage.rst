Installation
------------

To use Clypher, first install it using **make**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make install

Alternatively, you can install it using **pip**.

#. Navigate to the *project's root directory*. (Where ``setup.py`` is located.)

#. Install Clypher using **pip**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install .

To check that everything went well, you can run the ``--version`` command.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m clypher version

This should output "Clypher v |version|". If it does, then the installation succeeded.
